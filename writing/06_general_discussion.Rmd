Overall, we find strong evidence for habituation and novelty preferences in preschoolers and infants in a novel blocked familiarization/test paradigm. Despite prematurely interrupting familiarization to induce partial encoding, we failed to find attentional preferences for familiar stimuli in both preschoolers and infants, suggesting that partial encoding does not lead to familiarity preferences in our paradigm.

This evidence supports the notion that, in the current setting, the decision of how long to look at a stimulus can be understood in light of a simple information gain model, like the one presented in Cao et al. (2022), across the lifespan. This is in contrast to the idea that attention in development could be driven by a “knowledge gap”, which could motivate infants and children to complete their encoding of familiar stimuli. The failure to find familiarity preferences through targeted partial encoding should also serve as a constraint on interpretations of looking time results in which familiarity preferences are explained post-hoc, as it shows that such preferences may not arise generically. 

Of course, not finding familiarity preferences in our settings does not rule out their existence, in our paradigm or in general. First, familiarity preferences may be a lot subtler than novelty preferences, so that the statistical power that is needed to find familiarity preferences is higher than that achieved in the current study. A current large-scale study by the ManyBabies consortium (ManyBabies5, in prep) which aims to test the predictions made by H&A may give insight into this possibility. Second, evoking familiarity preferences may depend on the presentation mode of stimuli: While in our studies participants see one stimulus, familiar or novel, at a time, many studies reporting familiarity preferences follow a preferential looking set-up in which infants are presented with both familiar and novel stimuli simultaneously, and their relative looking time at each is recorded. It may be that familiarity preferences arise due to the recognition of a familiar stimulus among other stimuli, in which case our current paradigm would not be suited to detect them, though previous attempts in adults at evoking familiarity preferences through simultaneous presentation paradigms failed (Gustafson, 2021). A third option is that familiarity preferences are more likely to arise in an in-person setting. While our preschooler study was conducted in person, our infant studies were conducted fully remotely, and this could be a reason we were unable to capture familiarity preferences. However, the evidence for differences between online and in-person studies is weak, and a meta analysis by Chuey et al. (2022) found no differences between online and in-person studies. Finally, the learning problem faced by subjects may play a critical role in whether they will exhibit familiarity preferences. While in the current paradigm, subjects simply observe animate visual concepts, other domains may be more conducive to familiarity preferences. We speculate that stimuli in which there is deeper structure to be discovered may lead to subjects’ continued engagement with familiar stimuli in attempts to close a ‘knowledge gap’ (Loewenstein, 19XX).

In conclusion, our findings suggest that looking time in preschoolers and infants is well explained by a basic information gain model in which subjects increasingly seek novelty as they become familiarized to a stimulus. We do not find evidence for a non-linearity in information seeking behavior, despite explicitly inducing partial encoding through a novel looking paradigm in which we manipulate exposure within-subjects. Our findings suggest that familiarity preferences do not arise under generic circumstances of partial exposure to stimuli, and that post-hoc rationalizations of familiarity preferences observed in infant looking time data should be made with care. Instead, we think that understanding the requisite features of stimuli and subjects that elicit familiarity preferences should be a priority in looking time research.
