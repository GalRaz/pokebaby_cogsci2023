Overall, we developed a novel looking time paradigm for infants and preschoolers which tests the relationship between exposure duration and attentional preferences within-subjects. In this paradigm, we found strong evidence for habituation and novelty preferences. In contrast, despite prematurely interrupting familiarization to induce partial encoding, we failed to find attentional preferences for familiar stimuli in either preschoolers or infants, suggesting that partial exposure did not lead to familiarity preferences. Both the presence of novelty preferences and habituation and the absence of familiarity preferences were consistent across age groups, suggesting developmental continuity in our paradigm. 
These results are consistent with the idea that, in the current setting, the decision of how long to look at a stimulus can be understood in light of a simple information gain model, like the one presented in @cao2022habituation, across the lifespan. In contrast, our evidence does not support the idea that attention in development could be driven by a “knowledge gap” motivating infants and children to complete their encoding of familiar stimuli. If such a gap existed, it was too short to detect in our studies. The failure to find familiarity preferences through targeted partial encoding should also serve as a caution to interpretations of looking time results in which familiarity preferences are identified post-hoc, as it shows that such preferences may not arise generically. Some of these may instead be false positives.
Of course, not finding familiarity preferences in our settings does not rule out their existence, in our paradigm or in general. First, familiarity preferences may be more subtle than novelty preferences, so that the statistical power that is needed to find familiarity preferences is higher than that achieved in the current study. A current large-scale study by the ManyBabies consortium [@kosie2023manybabies] which aims to test the predictions made by H&A may give insight into this possibility. 
Second, evoking familiarity preferences may depend on the presentation mode of stimuli: While in our studies participants see one stimulus, familiar or novel, at a time, many studies reporting familiarity preferences follow a preferential looking set-up in which infants are presented with both familiar and novel stimuli simultaneously, and their relative looking time at each is recorded. It may be that familiarity preferences arise due to the recognition of a familiar stimulus among other stimuli, in which case our current paradigm would not be suited to detect them [though see @gustafsson2021visual].
Third, prior work has emphasized the role of affective processes in familiarity preferences. The mere exposure effect, a widely documented phenomenon in social psychology, suggested that brief exposure to certain stimuli would be sufficient to provoke a more positive affect [@zajonc1968attitudinal, @montoya2017re] . Therefore, it is possible that many documented familiarity preferences arise because of underlying positive affect. Including measurements that more directly tap into liking, such as reaching or pointing, and relating them to looking time, may help isolate the contribution of affect component in familiarity preferences. Finally, and most importantly perhaps, the learning context in which participants find themselves likely plays a critical role in whether they will exhibit familiarity preferences. This context-dependence is reflected in meta-analyses investigating familiarity preferences in different paradigms. For example, when tested on word segmentation, infants show a persistent preference for familiar stimuli throughout the first year [@bergmann2016development]. In contrast, when tested on statistical learning of novel words, infants show a consistent preference for novel stimuli, from 4-month- to 11 months of age [@black2017quantifying]. These seemingly contradictory results highlight the need for theories that formalize the relationship between the learning problem faced by participants and their attentional preferences. Recent computational work has begun to provide normative accounts of how context affects optimal exploration. For example, in environments in which past and present are correlated, a preference for familiar stimuli may arise to prepare for future encounters, while in uncorrelated environments, novelty preferences are optimal[(under some assumptions; see @dubey2020reconciling]. Similarly, in a rational analysis of attentional preferences, @cao2022habituation show that ideal learners attempting to maximize their expected information gain consistently seek novelty when trying to learn a single concept. But it is possible that once the learning goal or constraints on learning change e.g. by attempting to learn hierarchical concepts or imposing switch costs on learning new concepts, optimal information-seeking may include attending to familiar stimuli.
In conclusion, we find robust evidence for habituation and novelty preferences in preschoolers and infants, while failing to observe a non-linearity in information seeking behavior, despite attempting to induce partial encoding through a new looking paradigm in which we manipulate exposure within-subjects. Our findings suggest that familiarity preferences do not arise under all circumstances of limited exposure to stimuli, and that post-hoc rationalizations of familiarity preferences observed in infant looking time data should be made with care. Instead, we argue for the need for new theories and data to understand the requisite features of stimuli and learning contexts that elicit familiarity preferences.
