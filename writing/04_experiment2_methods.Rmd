We anticipated that preschoolers would show patterns of habituation and dishabituation similar to adults. We also expected to see developmental changes in the shape of habituation trajectories. Our pre-registered mixed-effect mod includes a three-way interaction term between age (in months), trial number, and trial type (background or deviant) to predict looking time. We found an interaction between [XXXX], suggesting that we successfully captured the habituation and dishabituation. However, we did not find evidence suggesting that age is associated with looking time (STATS). We also explored the potential familiarity preference by comparing the looking time at the second background trial and the second deviant trial. We ran a mixed effect model predicting looking time at the second trial, with the interaction term between age and trial type as the predictor. We found no evidence for familiarity preference across age groups (CITE).  

This current experiment replicated the finding in CITE. We captured habituation and dishabituation with a developmental sample. More importantly, under the current paradigm, we did not find any evidence of familiarity preference for this younger age group. We moved to the infant samples in the next experiment.
